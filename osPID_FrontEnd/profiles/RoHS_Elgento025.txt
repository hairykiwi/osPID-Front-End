5, 100, 217 //Step Output to 100% until crossing 217 degC - A 'place-marker' to enable a buzz as temperature rises through 217 degC - useful for monitoring time spent within critical heating phases, or as a flag in a data dump
127, 0, 1	//buzz for 1 seconds
5, 100, 245	//Step Output to 100% until crossing 245 degC - Approx 8 degC of overshoot needs to be anticipated, so stop heating at a point determined by experimentation.
